# A 'specific' Stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# snapshot: lts-23.24
# snapshot: nightly-2025-06-15
# snapshot: ghc-9.8.4
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# snapshot: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# snapshot: https://example.com/snapshots/2024-01-01.yaml
resolver: lts-24.21 # GHC 9.10.3

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
# packages:
# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
#   subdirs:
#   - auto-update
#   - wai
packages:
- .
# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the snapshot.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
extra-deps:
- hasql-1.10.2.1
- postgresql-binary-0.15.0.1@sha256:87408d09f3a0328067c698041ddcc6e1376cacbad3ed5b5337720ace019cd41b,3889
- postgresql-connection-string-0.1.0.5@sha256:75a679ef877121482615849517b1545535467456852c8690fdbfd715e512563b,3420
